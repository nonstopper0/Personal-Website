                <p>
                  My first ever web application. Built within 1 week using the technoligies listed above this was an amazing learning experience.
                  This project did a great job of showing me how neccesary frameworks like angular and react are for interactive apps like this.
                  This is an Instagram-like application where you can upload photos and have your own customized profile all within the site.

                This was my final project for my time at General Assembly. 
                This is a mock-trading app based off real numbers i pull from a stock market api. 
                During this project i ran into a problem with my api limits so i decided to store my own data and pull from there. 
                I use the api for data that is not updated then push it back to my database. 
                But my own database is always a priority pull. 
                I do a lot of formatting in the data coming from the api to then chart it onto the screen. 
                Users can buy and sell stocks on a daily basis and have $5000 to begin trading with. 
                This was styled with React Semantic UI with my own custom theme.</p>

              <p>
                This app was built by me and a few others within a span of a week during my time at General assembly. 
                It is quite simple, it is a platform for free-lance mechanics and customers to connect and have their cars serviced at home. 
                There are 2 profile types: User and Mechanic. 
                Depending on the profile you sign into you will receive 2 different user experiences.</p>
